  Content: ! "I love the emphasis you give important parts of the text. I don't want
    to sound like a turd at all but while reading (granted I'm reading with a finer
    eye since you asked me to review) I found that some seem inconsistent. Bold is
    used for Pro tips and syntax it seems while italic are being used as stylized
    text, editorial emphasis, and then for directional text, telling people what they
    should or shouldn't do. \n\nOverall, I didn't find it created a text that was
    difficult to read, just something I caught when I was looking with a really fine
    eye. "

    Seems like bolded are typically for syntax, not for style emphasis.

  Content: Yeah, I settled on `sub` because it's shorter and easier to type - the
    default is `subl`, but why not save a character where you can. Think this is worth

    it clear that this isn't a hard and fast, but when I first set this up I thought
    'subl' was all I could use. Then I realized if I just changed the word 'subl'

    it points to a branch which contains code, which could be interpreted as a location,
    but it''s very different from origin, which is a pointer to a _different repo_.
    The command is saying take the code in the master branch on my local repo, and
    push it to this remote github repo which I''m calling `origin`.


    I guess this is what I was trying to say when I put down _what_ to push and _where_
    to push here -- master is what you are pushing and origin is where to.'

    First off I have to say that this is fantastic. Clear, easy to read and really
    entertaining.


    I have a couple of comments simply from the perspective of a beginner who might
    not be so familiar with the command line/git.


    I like to think about ".." as going back a folder rather than as a parent directory.
    New users might confuse this with the home directory. I think it would be clearer
    to say something to the effect that entering ` ` ` cd .. ` ` ` lets you go back
    up the folder structure and obviously you won''t be able to go back anymore if
    you''re at the top.


    Let me know what you think.'
